I"<p>Zhongya Lin, a researcher in the field of solid mechanics and biophyscis. After obtaining his Bachelor’s degree from Northeastern University (China), he was granted direct admission to Peking University to study cross-scale mechanics with <a href="https://capt.pku.edu.cn/english/people/member/researchers/909950.htm">Prof. Yueguang Wei</a>. He was fascinated by how microstructures of advanced structural materials affect their macroscale mechanical properties. They attempted to identify the microstructural mechanisms and develop cross-scale theoretical and computational models.</p>

<p>Wishing to expand his research and apply the idea of multiple spatial and temporal scales to some biological problems, he joined the group of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Hpg2NCcAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Prof. Xi-Qiao Feng</a> at Tsinghua University as a postdoctoral researcher, where he tried to reveal the viscoelasticity/viscosity effect on tissue growth, morphogenesis and cell motility.</p>

<p>Inspired by amazing biological phenomena, he then moved to the lab of <a href="https://www.ibdm.univ-amu.fr/team/organisation-and-dynamics-of-biological-forms">Prof. Thomas Lecuit</a> at IBDM &amp; CNRS in Marseille, France, to study the biophysical mechanisms underlying development.</p>

<p>He is also interested in artificial intelligence (AI), and he did some demos in computer vision during 2017 - 2020. He is also exploring research topics in AI for Science, more specifically in AI for Mechanics and AI for Biophysics.</p>
