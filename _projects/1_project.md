For the cross-scale feature of materials with significant miscrostructural effect, we first developed a strain gradient viscoelasticity thoery {% cite lin2020strain %} {% cite lin2021strain %}. Then, we implemented the finite element simulation for the strain gradient viscoelasticity by writing the mixed-finite element code. We also used PINN to implement the strain gradient viscoelastic simulation (in preparation). In the meantime, we developed a strain gradient visco-plasticity theory to extend the cross-scale theory {% cite Liu2026 %}.
