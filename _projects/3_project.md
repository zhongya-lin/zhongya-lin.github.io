Inspired by past insights into multiscale problems, including the establishment of cross-scale theories {% cite lin2020strain %} and multiscale mechanisms of viscoelasticity in biological tissues {% cite lin2025mechanobiological %}, we investigated a more microscopic biomechanical issue: cell migration in viscous environments {% cite lin2025adaptive %}. We investigated how the actin filament network responds to external viscous environments, leading to faster migration rates in high-viscosity (high-resistance) conditions. Furthermore, we explained the migration rate memory effect arising from cytoskeletal dynamics.
