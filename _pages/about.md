Zhongya Lin, a researcher in the field of solid mechanics and biophyscis. After obtaining his Bachelor’s degree from Northeastern University (China), he was granted direct admission to Peking University to study cross-scale mechanics with [Prof. Yueguang Wei](https://capt.pku.edu.cn/english/people/member/researchers/909950.htm). He was fascinated by how microstructures of advanced structural materials affect their macroscale mechanical properties. They attempted to identify the microstructural mechanisms and develop cross-scale theoretical and computational models. 

Wishing to expand his research and apply the idea of multiple spatial and temporal scales to some biological problems, he joined the group of [Prof. Xi-Qiao Feng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Hpg2NCcAAAAJ&hl=en) at Tsinghua University as a postdoctoral researcher, where he tried to reveal the viscoelasticity/viscosity effect on tissue growth, morphogenesis and cell motility. 

Inspired by amazing biological phenomena, he then moved to the lab of [Prof. Thomas Lecuit](https://www.ibdm.univ-amu.fr/team/organisation-and-dynamics-of-biological-forms) at IBDM & CNRS in Marseille, France, to study the biophysical mechanisms underlying development. 

He is also interested in artificial intelligence (AI), and he did some demos in computer vision during 2017 - 2020. He is also exploring research topics in AI for Science, more specifically in AI for Mechanics and AI for Biophysics.
